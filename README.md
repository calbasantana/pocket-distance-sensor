# Introduction
When I had my old car, a 2018 Mazda CX-3, I was always getting frustrated with how hard it was to tell if I was close to another car or not when parking. My car didn't have a built-in proximity sensor, so I decided to take on this project to build one for it.

The idea being that if I had a distance sensor (light-based or sound-based) at the front of the car and hooked up the circuitry inside the car with the small screen, I could make it all work. However, I was in the middle of buying a new car and this project took on a different form, one of being a pocket distance sensor. It certainly isn't perfect, but it is a cool little thing. In the future, I would love to make it more compact.

# Materials
This pocket distance sensor makes use of the following:

- 3D-printed case
- Custom PCB
- Hardware parts

In the following sections, I will get into more details about each.

## 3D-Printed Case

I decided to go with something simple; something that could hold the battery and the screen with everything else in between.

There are a total of 4 files attached here for this case:

- Case Top
- Case Bottom
- Battery Cover
- 4X Magnet Cover

I personally did not end up using the Battery Cover I designed and I found the Magnet Covers to be unnecessary if you're using strong glue to keep the magnets in their place.

# Tips
 It can be hard to align the card precisely. For this reason, I recommend using some scotch tape on either both or one of the sides of the metal card. I didnâ€™t have scotch tape readily available, so I carefully added some electrical tape.
